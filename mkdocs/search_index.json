            "text": "User Guide\n\n\nConfiguration and usage of ColorHelper.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Usage\n\n\nColorHelper is a CSS/SCSS/Sass tooltip.  When the cursor is on a CSS color, the tooltip will appear. When entering a color into a supported file, the color palette panel will be triggered so you can optionally insert a color from a saved palette.  The panel will popup after either: \n#\n, \nrgb(\n, \nrgba(\n, \nhsl(\n or \nhsla(\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPopups are provided by the \nmdpopups\n dependency.\n\n\n\n\nColor Info\n\n\nThe Color Info Panel will show a preview of the color, and other format variations of the color such as: color name, hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, and hsla format; if desired, you can convert the selected color to one of the shown formats by clicking the link to the left.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the color info panel, you can launch a color picker, bookmark colors as a favorite, add/save the current color to a palette of your choice, or open the \nPalette Panel\n to select a pre-saved color from an existing palette.\n\n\nColor Picker\n\n\nThe internal color picker can be launched from the view\ns context menu, the command palette, or from the \nColor Info Panel\n.  When launched it will use the color under the cursor (if available) as its starting color. The internal color picker is contained inside a tooltip.  It has a color map section at the top where different colors can be selected. It shows various valid CSS formats of the colors at the bottom.  And it shows either rgba channels or hlsa channels; a toggle is available to switch between them.\n\n\n\n\nThe color channels are coarse, but can generally allow you to get close to a color that you like.  As you select colors in the channel the selections will shift revealing more selections until the bounds of the color channel are reached.  If you need finer selections, you can click the label to the left and scrollable tooltip with much finer selections will appear so that you can select the best suited value.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to pick from a list of CSS color names, you can select the \nCSS color names\n link and a CSS Color Names panel will open:\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to directly enter a different color, you can select the \nenter new color\n option.  An input panel will be open that can receive a color in the hex form of \n#RRGGBBAA\n where \nRR\n is the red channel, \nGG\n is the green channel, \nBB\n is the blue channel, and \nAA\n is the alpha channel.\n\n\nTo select a color, just click the \n link to the right of the CSS format yu want.\n\n\nAdd Color Panel\n\n\nThe Add Color Panel presents the user with the option of either adding a color to an existing palette or creating a new global or project palette and adding the color to it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating a new palette, the user will be presented with a input box to type the name of the palette to create.\n\n\nPalette Panel\n\n\nThe Palette panel will allow you to view the current saved palettes: favorites, saved user palette, and saved project palettes.\n\n\n\n\nThe Favorites palette and user palettes are found in your \nPackages/User/color_helper.palettes\n.  Project palettes are stored in your actual project file; if one does not exist, it will be stored in memory.\n\n\nBy clicking a palette, you will be taken to the \nColor Panel\n to select a color to insert into the current document.  You can also access the \nPalette Delete Panel\n directly.\n\n\nPalette Delete Panel\n\n\nThe Palette Delete Panel allows a user to delete an existing palette.  The only palettes that cannot be deleted is the Favorites palette and the Current Colors palette (if enabled).\n\n\n\n\nTo delete a palette, a user simply clicks a palette and it will be removed.\n\n\nColor Panel\n\n\nThe Color Panel allows you to click a color to insert it at your current color position.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also bring up the \nColor Delete Panel\n from the view\ns context menu or the command palette.\n\n\nColor Delete Panel\n\n\nThe Color Delete Panel can delete any color from the given palette.  A user simply clicks the color to remove, and it will be removed.\n\n\n\n\nSettings\n\n\nSettings for Color Helper are contained within the \ncolor_helper.sublime-settings\n file.\n\n\nauto_popup\n\n\nEnable/disable auto popups.\n\n\n    \n// Show popups automatically in configured files.\n\n    \nauto_popup\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupper_case_hex\n\n\nWhen inserting a color from the tooltip, this setting will determine if hex colors get uppercased or lowercased.\n\n\n    \n// Upper case hex when inserting\n\n    \nupper_case_hex\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_webcolor_names\n\n\nWill determine if a HTML color name will be shown for the currently selected colors. If inserting a web color name, transparency will be removed.\n\n\n    \n// Use webcolor names when value color matches a webcolor name.\n\n    \nuse_webcolor_names\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick_color_box_to_pick\n\n\nThis will make the color preview box in the \nColor Info Panel\n clickable.  When set to \ncolor_picker\n and clicked, it will open the color picker via the \nColorPicker\n plugin (if installed).  When set to \npalette_picker\n and clicked, it will open the \nPalette Panel\n. The respective menu item will not be shown in the \nColor Info Panel\n once relocated to the color preview.\n\n\n    \n// Color picker and palette picker by default\n\n    \n// are accessed by clicking an icon on the color info panel.\n\n    \n// Click access for one of thesecan be moved to the color box\n\n    \n// (visual representation of the color).\n\n    \n// (none|color_picker|palette_picker)\n\n    \nclick_color_box_to_pick\n:\n \nnone\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraphic_size\n\n\nControls the size of generated graphics.  Graphics in the tooltips look best large as Sublime slightly distorts images, but on small screens, some of the tooltips (especially the internal color picker) may be too large.  \ngraphic_size\n can be used ot control the size of these generated images.  Valid settings are \nsmall\n, \nmedium\n, and \nlarge\n where \nmedium\n is the default.\n\n\n    \n// If the color picker is too big, try playing with this.\n\n    \n// Graphics in tooltips usually look better bigger (especially in Hidpi),\n\n    \n// but that can make the tooltips really big. If they are too big,\n\n    \n// you can play with this setting.  We compromise with medium.\n\n    \n// (small | medium | large)\n\n    \ngraphic_size\n:\n \nmedium\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable_color_picker\n\n\nEnables the ability to launch the color picker from the tooltip.  By default, the internal color picker will be used.  If you have \n@weslly\ns \nColorPicker\n package installed, you can use \nuse_color_picker_package\n to use it instead of the internal color picker.\n\n\n    \n// Enable color picker option.

When enabled, the color picker has a hex shape as the colors fan out from the white center.  If disabled, the color picker will be a rectangular one that shows the colors by hue and by brightness.\n\n\n    \n// This can be turned off to get a rectangular color picker\n\n    \n// That displays possible options by hue and brightness/luminance.\n\n    \nuse_hex_color_picker\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisabled look\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_color_picker_package\n\n\nIf you have \n@weslly\ns \nColorPicker\n package installed, \nuser_color_picker_package\n will cause it to override the default color picker, but only the default color picker supports transparency.\n\n\n    \n// Use https://github.com/weslly/ColorPicker for the color picker if installed.\n\n    \nuse_color_picker_package\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable_global_user_palettes\n\n\nEnables showing user palettes (found in \nPackages/User/color_helper.palettes\n) in the \nPalette Panel\n.\n\n\n    \n// Show global palettes in palette panel\n\n    \nenable_global_user_palettes\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable_favorite_palette\n\n\nEnables showing the Favorites palette (found in \nPackages/User/color_helper.palettes\n) in the \nPalette Panel\n.\n\n\n    \n// Enable storing favorite colors to the favorite palette\n\n    \nenable_favorite_palette\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable_current_file_palette\n\n\nEnables scanning of the current active view buffer for colors and showing them in the Current Colors palette in the \nPalette Panel\n.\n\n\n    \n// Enable showing current file color palette\n\n    \nenable_current_file_palette\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable_project_user_palettes\n\n\nEnables showing and storing of user palettes in the project file.

You can install nose via:\n\n\npip install nose\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:\n\n\nnosetests .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed on the entire project with \nflake8\n, \nflake8_docstrings\n, and \npep8-naming\n.

If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn\nt be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.\n\n\nYou don\nt have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of \nmkdocs\n with my own custom Python Markdown \nextensions\n to render the docs.
